								Thomas shelby, our main character of the series had served the army in recent past as a coal miner in birmingham war, and he was one among the best coal miners. He is am englishman 'gypsy' from birmingham who also owns a pub, along with horses ofcourse. Now, he has started him own private bussiness as shelby limited, where he and his family(2 more brothers, 1 sister and polly) set the bets on races held on a race track; where they actually fix the races illegally using their gypsy stuff. He wishes to rule over the world using his guns and ammunition.
                                But his plans have now grown beyond just setting the bets. He wants to buy some race tracks and start doing bussiness legitimately. For that they need to pursue billy kimber, the owner of most of the race tracks in england. Also, peaky blinders had stolen a missing crate of ammunition from army. Leading to this robbery, the king's officials appoint Mr.Campbell to solve the case. Campbell, quite sure that shelby's had stolen the guns, sends in her daughter figure and police officer, Grace as a pub woman, to 'seduce' thomas shelby and find the place of hiding of guns. Billy kimber has some issues with lee family, which also has issues with shelby family. So, lees are common enemy of both shelbys
                                and kimber. Lee family had been a source of consant trouble for kimber because they had been looting the kimber. So, thomas shelby took this opportunity as his own. He offers kimber his security for the price of some of the race tracks in the south plus legal betting in all the race tracks. Though he had further plans to eliminate billy kimber also.	Kimber, who is unable for finding any ways against them, agrees with tommy shelby. Soon, thomas and grace fall in love with each other. And grace, being a very capable officer, finds out the position of guns and tells it to campbell on the condition that campbell will spare thomas.
								Campbell, on other hand, also falls in love with grace, and finding out that she falls in love with thomas, he grows envious of thommas. So, he tries to kill thommas with the help of billy kimber, who eventually also wants to get rid of thommas. <br><br> Now, almost everything turned against him, can thommas shelby protect billy kimber from lee family? Can he himself save himself from billy kimber? Why has he stolen that ammunition from the government? Can he defends himself from the main villain i.e., Mr. Campbell? Can he ever find out that the girl to whom he loves actually is an officer, and she is the one who told the information of
                                guns to campbell?<br> And most importantly, can he win all those race tracks and succeed??????
