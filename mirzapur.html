								This movie starts with phoolchand tripathi who is the son of akhandanand tripathi, or kaleen bhaiya, the alleged don of mirzapur, a city in Uttar Pradesh of India. Their family includes akhandanand tripathi(kaleen bhaiya), his son munna, his second wife, and his father. Phoolchand tripathi, or Munna as he is often called as, is the main cause of worry for his father, because he is incapable of doing anything perfectly. He kills a bridegroom accidently, while doing air fires, and then he starts laughing over it.
								Kaleeen bhaiya himself has the illegal bussiness of desi katte(illegal guns). Kaleen bhaiya rules over mirzapur. Even a leaf does not flutter without his permission in his city. But he needs a worthy person to help him in his bussiness. Munna, being the son of kaleen, rules over the college. He had given his name for the president of th college. But, he soon finds out that there has been another competitor
								against him, who stood for president's position. Hence, he runs after him to beat him down. It's when we meets another main characters of this series, guddu pandit, and bablu pandit. They both are also studying in same college as munna, and guddu had helped munna in catching that another competitor. Guddu always wanted a life like that of munna, a life where everyone obeys him, a life of power. He wants to become a bodybuilder, whereas bablu wants a simple life. They both are brothers, and son of a lawyer. Their family include those 2 brothers,their sister,their father, and their mother
								. Story turns around like this that the family of bridegroom to whom munna had killed want to file a case against munna. So, they go to the father of guddu and bablu. So, when munna and his father finds out this, they send their goons to threaten ram sharan mishra, father of guddu. His father, being a honest lawyer rejects to leave the case. Then, they break into their house to threaten him. Guddu and bablu fight with them.  <br>
								Then, bablu and guddu start working for kaleen bhaiya. They organise themselves into the gun making bussiness, and distributing it among the neighbouring area. In the neighbouring area, there are many rivals of kaleen also, who envy kaleen bhaiya and the power of guddu and bablu. On the other hand, his relations with political leader of the area also begins to flatter. Also, to increase the tension of kaleen bhaiya, there os the transfer of new police inspector, who wants to put a hault to the bussiness of kaleen.<br> Can akhandanand tripathi, or as to say kaleen bhaiya save himself from so many underlying problems
								<br><br> When this seems not enough, munna starts to envy guddu and bablu, because he starts to think that his father seems to show more interest in both of them. So, he plans to get rid of these two<br><br> Can munna kill guddu and bablu? Can any of those rivals get kaleen bhaiya?? What will happen to the gun manufacturing bussiness of kaleen bhaiya.<br><br> It's a treat to watch this...
